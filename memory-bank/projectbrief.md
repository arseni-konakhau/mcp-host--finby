# Project Brief

This project implements an MCP LLM orchestration and chat service using Java Spring Boot.
It provides RESTful endpoints for chat, intent analysis, and integration with external LLM services (DeepSeek) and MCP tools (Jira, Confluence).
The system is designed for extensibility, robust error handling, and clear separation of concerns.
